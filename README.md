# Daily-Planner-App

## A Daily Planner Application build around JavaScript, HTML and CSS

In this application we have created a Daily Planner for your workday.

This app uses advanced JavaScript, CSS & HTML as well as the integration of third party API's.

This app when opened in a browser should:
    *   Show the current date at the top of the planner.
    *   Show standard business hours timeblocks for the user.
    *   Timeblocks should be colour coded to show past, present & future.
    *   Clicking on a timeblock allows the user to enter an event.
    *   Clicking on the save icon will save the event to lacal storage.
    *   Refreshing the page will  not reset events, unless  the clear button is pressed.
